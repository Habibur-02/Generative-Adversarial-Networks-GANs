# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs
A PyTorch implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation. Includes basic DCGAN, conditional GAN (cGAN), and other variants. Train your own GAN on custom datasets to generate realistic images
🎨 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in PyTorch

A collection of PyTorch implementations for various Generative Adversarial Networks, including:

DCGAN: Deep Convolutional GAN

cGAN: Conditional GAN

WGAN: Wasserstein GAN

WGAN-GP: WGAN with Gradient Penalty

Train these models on custom datasets to generate high-quality images.

📚 Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models comprising two neural networks—the Generator and the Discriminator—that compete against each other. This adversarial process enables the generation of realistic images from random noise.

This repository provides implementations of several GAN variants, allowing you to experiment with different architectures and loss functions.

⚙️ Features

Modular Codebase: Easily switch between different GAN architectures.

Custom Dataset Support: Train models on your own image datasets.

Preprocessing Pipelines: Includes data augmentation and normalization techniques.

Evaluation Metrics: Tools to assess the quality of generated images.
